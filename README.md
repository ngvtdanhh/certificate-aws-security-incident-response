## 📝 Course Review

This course delivers a solid introduction to incident response workflows within AWS. With cloud-native tooling like GuardDuty, CloudTrail, and AWS Config, the course emphasizes **automation**, **visibility**, and **response readiness**.

### ✅ What I Liked

- Modular, easy-to-follow structure  
- Practical examples of threats and AWS-native solutions  
- Good introduction to cloud-specific response workflows

### 📌 Areas to Improve

- Could expand more on third-party integrations (e.g., SOAR)  
- Limited real-time lab interaction (mostly theory)

---

## 🧭 Ideal For

- Cloud Security Beginners  
- Blue Team or DevSecOps members  
- Learners preparing for AWS Security Specialty or incident response roles
