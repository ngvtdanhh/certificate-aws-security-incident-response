## ðŸ§­ Detection Sources

| Source        | Purpose                                     |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| GuardDuty     | Anomaly detection for AWS resources         |
| CloudTrail    | Records API calls and account activity      |
| VPC Flow Logs | Traffic patterns and IP-level visibility    |
| AWS Config    | Resource drift or unauthorized changes      |
| Security Hub  | Centralized alert management                |

## ðŸ“ˆ Severity Classification

AWS recommends classifying incidents by:

- Impact (data loss, unauthorized access)
- Scope (single instance vs. entire VPC/account)
- Exposure time
- Compliance requirements (PCI, HIPAA, etc.)

---

## ðŸ“ž Escalation Paths

- Use CloudWatch Alarms to trigger SNS notifications
- Incident automation via Lambda + Step Functions
- Notify stakeholders via AWS Chatbot, email, or ticketing tools

---

## ðŸ§  Best Practices

- Define escalation tiers (SOC analyst â†’ SecOps â†’ CISO)
- Periodically review alert thresholds and false positives
- Use runbooks for response consistency
