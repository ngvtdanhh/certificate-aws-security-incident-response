# 🛡️ AWS Incident Response Process

AWS follows a structured and iterative incident response (IR) process to detect, analyze, contain, and mitigate security events in cloud environments.

---

## 📌 1. Preparation

- Define roles and responsibilities (IR playbook)
- Establish monitoring with GuardDuty, CloudTrail, and AWS Config
- Enable MFA, IAM least privilege, centralized logging

## ⚠️ 2. Detection & Analysis

- GuardDuty alerts for reconnaissance, credential compromise, etc.
- CloudTrail logs user/API activity
- AWS Security Hub aggregates findings

## 🚨 3. Containment & Mitigation

- Isolate compromised instances (Security Groups or Network ACLs)
- Revoke temporary credentials
- Use automation (Lambda or Step Functions) to trigger response

## 🔄 4. Recovery & Lessons Learned

- Restore from known good AMI or backup
- Conduct root cause analysis
- Update detection rules and playbooks

---

## 🔁 Continuous Improvement

- Test IR plans with tabletop exercises
- Use AWS IR Simulation Templates
- Audit CloudTrail, Config, and IAM regularly
